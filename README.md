# Finding Waldo using OpenCV
I made this small program to practice programming in C++ and try out OpenCV. The program uses template matching to find Waldo in a picture and darken everything else. In practice, template matching would be an inappropiate way to find Waldo because you need to know what he looks like in the puzzle before starting the search.
